ZXING

Supports most standard barcode formats, including:
UPC/EAN extensions
MaxiCode
RSS/DataBar symbologies
Industrial formats like ITF, Code 93, etc.

## Google ML Kit

Still lacks support for:
UPC/EAN extensions
MaxiCode

ML Kit SDK does collect metadata for diagnostics and usage analytics

It tracks usage patterns (e.g., how often barcode detection is triggered)
Logs device and app metadata
May associate this with a per-installation ID
This is a concern in regulated environments (e.g., healthcare, defense, enterprise) where any telemetry is considered a riskâ€”even if anonymized.
